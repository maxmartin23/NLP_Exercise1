# Exercise1
Natural language processing and recommender systems


# Association Rules

Build a small recommender app to recommend the top ingredients used
in a certain cuisine type, for example, Italian, Greek cuisines...etc.
You will base your recommendations after mining recipe data posted on the web. The data has already
been collected and available in the attached “recipes.Json”. You will be using the
apriori algorithm to come up with the rules.
